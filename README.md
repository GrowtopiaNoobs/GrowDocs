# Growtopia Packets documentation

This repostitory contain markdown files with explanations what packets do growtopia have and how they work, but you won't find almost any code here.

There are two servers required for growtopia to work:
- [HTTP Server](http_server/README.md)
- [ENet Server](enet_server/README.md)

You will find under those links how each of those parts works.

Also you should check this stuff which is directly or undirectly related to packets:
- [Types definiton](types_definition.md)
- [Items dat](items_dat/README.md)
